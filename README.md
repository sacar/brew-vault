# Beer Vault

## Description

This project is a simple beer list web application that displays two tabs: "All Beers" and "My Beers". The "All Beers" tab fetches beers from an API, while the "My Beers" tab allows users to add their custom beers. Custom beers added by users will be displayed in the "My Beers" tab. The application provides a mockup-styled interface and allows users to interact by viewing beers fetched from the API and adding their custom beers.
